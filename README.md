# LDK Engine

The LDK, or **Ludum Dev Kit**, is being developed from scratch in C, to provide complete control over functionality and appearance, enabling customization for a wide range of game projects without relying on external dependencies. 

This development process offers valuable learning experiences in game design and coding, enhancing technical skills and problem-solving abilities. 

Ultimately, the aim is design a fast and versatile framework suitable for my own games.

## Should I use it ?

Yes, but no. I am developing it for my own games however if it fits your needs feel free to to use it.
